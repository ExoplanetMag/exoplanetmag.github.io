<p>Exoplanet Magazine is a digital publication for speculative short fiction in alternative formats, founded in July 2025 and edited by <a target="_blank" href="https://patrickdlee.com">Patrick D. Lee</a>.</p>

<p>There was a previous incarnation of an Exoplanet Magazine between 2018 and 2020, but that was run by a different team with a different vision. It's always sad to see a short fiction magazine shut down, but the name fits our concept well and the domain was available, so we ran with it.</p>
